# Tabs


The tables are not part of the heart of the Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) and Markdown Here supports them.

Here is an example of a table with the result below:

    | Tables | Are | Cools |
    | ------------- |: ---------------: | -----: |
    | col 3 is | aligned to the right | $ 1600 |
    | col 2 is | centered | $ 12 |
    | the zebras | are swag | $ 1 |


| Tables | Are | Cools |
| ------------- |: ---------------: | -----: |
| col 3 is | aligned to the right | $ 1600 |
| col 2 is | centered | $ 12 |
| the zebras | are swag | $ 1 |

Both points can be used to align columns

The traits (|) are optional and you do not need to make the Markdown raw fit perfectly. You can also use inline Markdown.

Example:

    Markdown | Enough | Ugly
    --- | --- | ---
    * Appears * | `always` | **good**
    1 | 2 | 3
