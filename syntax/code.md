# The code blocks

Pre-formatted code blocks are used to write programming or to highlight a code source. More than a simple pragma, the lines of code of a block of code are literally interpreted.

Here is an example:

`` `
This is a block of code
`` `

To create a block of code in Markdown, just identify each row of the block with less than 4 spaces or a tab.

For example :

`` `
This is a normal paragraph:

This is a block of code.
`` `

You can also create a separate code block with:

`` `

### Online code block

The online code blocks can be written using:

For example:

This is an online code block

### The syntax for highlighting

You can define the language used to highlight the syntax by adding a name to an opening keyword. Example:

`` `js
var a = {};
`` `
